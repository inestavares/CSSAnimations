CSS Animations Sandbox
===

Some little tests to learn how to use sequential CSS animations, with a little help from JavaScript.

[Demo here.](http://inestavares.github.io/CSSAnimations/).


The animations are currently chained by removing the invisible class and adding a further class from a sequential array of animation classes. It may be an option, in the future, to add data attributes so the script knows which animation applies to each element, as we are already using an index to iterate over the animatable elements.
